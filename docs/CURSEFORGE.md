# Twilight Forest Boss Mod (remake)

An additional mod to add the final boss to The Twilight Forest mod.

## Features

1. Adds a final boss to the Twilight Forest called the Castle Keeper, which has unique animations, attacks, phases, and loot.
2. Adds a way to create the cube of annihilation with drops from the Castle Keeper.
3. Adds two new advancements related to the Castle Keeper.

## Requirements
* [The Twilight Forest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-twilight-forest)
* [GeckoLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)
* [TwilightTweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/twilight-tweaks)

## Warning

* The version shown in files is in the fixed format, `${mod_version}+${twilight_forest_version}+${mc_version}`. They mean the environment we successfully tested. If there's any problem to crash, please try the closer version of minecraft or twilight forest mod.

## Note

This mod is a maintained version.
The original one isn't updated anymore.
After getting the permission from the original author, D_Angry_Modder,
this new project was created.

It isn't just a copy of the original one, but a remake.
I will continue to update this mod until the TwilightForest official mod updates its actual final boss.
